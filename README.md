# My Portfolio Site


## Overview
This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio. It's a simple static site built with HTML to highlight my background, projects, and accomplishments.

## Installation / Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Portfolio
   ```
3. Optionally start a local development server to preview the site:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then visit `http://localhost:8000/Main.html` in your browser.

## Usage
- Open `Main.html` directly in any modern web browser.
- Customize the content by editing `Main.html` and adding your own styles or images.

## Build and Deployment
The site is entirely static, so no build step is required. To deploy:

- **GitHub Pages**: push the repository to GitHub and enable Pages for the `main` branch.
- **Static hosting**: upload `Main.html` and any supporting assets to your preferred hosting provider.
